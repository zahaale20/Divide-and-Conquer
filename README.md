In this project, I designed and implemented a divide-and-conquer algorithm in Python to solve a specific problem: identifying the unique, singleton element in a sorted sequence of integers, where all elements except one are duplicated. My program efficiently manages this task by dividing the problem space into smaller sub-problems, then combining their solutions to find the singleton element. The algorithm performs this by checking the middle element of the sequence and its neighbors; depending on whether these elements are duplicates and the position (odd or even) of the middle element, the search space is halved accordingly. This method ensures a highly efficient search, minimizing the number of comparisons needed to find the singleton. The program reads integers from a file, where each line contains a single integer from the sequence, and outputs the singleton element to stdout.
